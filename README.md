# cmps183-ucsc-psa
Our project for cmps183

So I copied the welcome application and pushed it to this repository, 
I figured we could just edit it to our liking and add what we need for our project.

To use this I think you have to add it as a application to an existing web2py project like Luca's stuff.
If it doesn't work i'll just have to reinitialize it so no big deal.
